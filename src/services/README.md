# Service logic

- Services are independant and interact with external world
- API requests, localstorage API, etcâ€¦
-

```typescript
	/api - `stores api classes (singletons) for calling network requests`
```

```typescript
	/adapters - `contains implementation of port interfaces from /application/ports`
```
